This is my first big project, creating an Ecommerce website with model and views in Spring Boot. I configured security, authentication and authorization with latest syntax. I added a feature where you get a receipt as a pdf.

Future pospects:
* Searching
* Pagination
* ~~Security upgrade~~
* ~~Sales report feature~~
